## Boston Lobster Roll is a project for House Price Prediction
 
Housing is one of our most essential needs, along with other fundamental needs. 
Over the years, people's living standards have  improved so as the demand for housing. 

We will use machine learning algorithms to build a prediction model for house prices that may provide a lot of information and knowledge to home buyers,   
property investors, and housebuilders, such as the valuation of house prices in the present market, which will help them determine house prices.  
Meanwhile, this model can help potential buyers decide the characteristics of a house they want according to their budget.
